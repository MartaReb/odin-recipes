        <li>1 tsp (5 g) baking soda</li>

        <li>1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Toppings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened soy Greek-style yogurt</li>
        <li>1 cup (150 g) fresh mixed berries</li>
        <li>⅓ cup (48 g) mixed unsalted roasted nuts, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp (18 g) roasted pumpkin seeds, chopped (optional) </li>
        <li>Optional toppings</li>
        <li>maple syrup</li>
        <li>powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To a blender, add the tofu, pea milk, maple syrup, vanilla, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>To a large bowl, add the spelt flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well. Then add the wet ingredients from the blender. Mix until just combined, but be careful not to over-mix. If the mixture is too thick, add a splash of plant milk to thin it out a touch.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick crêpe pan on medium-high heat and use a bit of oil to lightly grease the pan. Use a ¼ measuring cup to pour the batter onto the pan. Cook for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Continue with the leftover batter.</li>
        <li>Top with yogurt, nuts, berries, and maple syrup if desired, and enjoy.</li>
